                <strong className="font-bold">Restrict Betting Automatically:</strong> We feel that to
                help you curb your gambling activity, the best and most practical way is to limit the
                deposit. This has been effective and is set at a maximum of AUD $1000. Once you reach
                this limit per day, you will not be able to bet or spend anymore. Since our site only
                allows for one USER ID per person, we will also not allow you to try from any other
                account.

                <strong className="font-bold">Set Limits:</strong> This is the second method we have
                employed. As players, you set a limit on your daily, weekly, and monthly spending. This
                is what you have to do once at the beginning of the month. Once you reach this level, you
                cannot bet more. We advise this method to every new or first-time gamer to practice.

                players who love our site and the games immensely. However, their love may sometimes
                over-exceed their spending capacity. They may end up becoming a problem for their entire
