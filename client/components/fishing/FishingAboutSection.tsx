              Fishing games are digital shooting-style arcade games that have become incredibly
              popular in Asia. Instead of spinning reels or flipping cards, players control a
              virtual cannon to shoot at different types of fish. Each fish has its own value,
              and players earn rewards based on their accuracy and strategy.

              These games are usually played in real time and feature dynamic visuals, bonus
              stages, and multiplier effects that enhance the thrill. What sets them apart is
              the balance between skill and chance, players who master their timing and target
              selection tend to win more.
